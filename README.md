FOL Evaluator
=====================


The FOL Evaluator is a semantic calculator written in JavaScript which will evaluate a well-formed formula of first-order logic on a user-specified model and determine the formula's truth value on that model.  As part of its output, the program provides a description of the entire evaluation process used to determine the formula's truth value.  If you come across any bugs, please email me at mrieppel at gmail dot com.

A live version of the program is [here](??).
