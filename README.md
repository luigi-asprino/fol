FOL Evaluator
=============


The FOL Evaluator is a semantic calculator which will evaluate a well-formed formula of first-order logic on a user-specified model.  In its output, the program provides not just the formula's truth value, but also a description of the entire evaluation process used to determine that truth value. If you come across any bugs, please email me at mrieppel at gmail dot com.

A live version of the program is [here](https://mrieppel.github.io/fol/).
